\section{Description of the project}
One problem that a beekeeper can encounter in spring, is the sudden swarming of his bees. They do so to find a new location for their colony.

In this project we want to count the number of bees that enter and leave the hive at any particular time, to be able to detect such a bee swarming. Using a GoPro camera we will take several short videos and apply background subtraction and segmentation with OpenCV to recognize the bees. To track the path of the bees in 3D we will use COLMAP.

For the support of our project we found a paper which uses the tracking system 'SwarmSigth' and one camera to count the bees.

% A high level description of the project, mentioning the main goal, the input and planned output data. Typically 4-5 sentences, also citing immediately related literature \cite{paper}.
% Je ne sais pas comment il faut citer le paper: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29364251

\section{Work packages and timeline}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\hline
Task & Group Member & Time period \\ \hline
Literature research & Everyone & week 3 to 4 \\ \hline
Get familiar with Python, OpenCV and Colmap & Everyone & week 3 to 5 \\ \hline

Detailed descriptions of work packages you planned, their outcomes, the responsible group member and estimated timeline. Specify the challenges that will be tackled and considered solutions with possible alternatives, citing related documents if applicable. Mention the platform (Android, PC etc.) and the language (C++ etc.) you plan to use.

\section{Outcomes and Demonstration}

In the of this project we want to be able to count the bees entering and leaving a hive and to track them using a single camera. We will show our result using a recorded video.
% Give detailed information on the expected outcome of your project and the experiments you plan to test your implementation. If applicable, describe the online or offline demo you plan to present at the end of the semester.
