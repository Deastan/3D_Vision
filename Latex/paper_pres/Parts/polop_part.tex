Using (varying) active illumination and reconstructing a scene from multiple images

\begin{itemize}
\item Shortcomings:
\item Low mapping rate (~30Hz)
\item Motion artifacts
\item Multipath-interference
\end{itemize}

Spatial patterns projected on the scene

\begin{itemize}
\item Shortcomings:
\item Robustness issues
\item Motion artifacts
\item Limited depth-range
\item Overlapping sensors cause interference

\subsection{Solution to a lot of these issues: Active Stereo:}
\begin{frame}{Solution to a lot of these issues: Active Stereo:}

Using 2 calibrated cameras and 1 pattern-projecting light source

\begin{itemize}
\item Mitigates multipath reflections
\item Improves robustness
\item Avoids interference between multiple systems
\item
\item BUT correspondence search has high computational cost
\end{itemize}
